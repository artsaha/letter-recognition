To train with our code -- letters_soft.ipynb

To train and test with sklearn model - sklearn_mlp.ipynb 

To test our learned weights and biases - letter_test.ipynb 

To one-hot encode (we did it though, files are ready) - one_hot.ipynb 

Resulting images were saved in ./images 

Resulting weights are in ./model 

Other experiments, with other activation functions, layer number and sizes in ./experiments
